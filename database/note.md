### Basic information

* **Identity column**  
a column (also known as a field) in a database table that is made up of values generated by the database. 
This is much like an AutoNumber field in Microsoft Access or a sequence in Oracle.  

* **The order of returned result**  
It is never guaranteed that the returned result by do select is ordered unless we add ORDER BY, no matter it is ORACLE or SQL SERVER.
